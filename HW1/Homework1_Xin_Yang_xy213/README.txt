# Test case path is set to the first given cases or the one I generated.
# There may be pre-compiled '.class' files in the folder, strongly suggest delete and re-compile.

  Compile class where main function are in, named by specific homework as 'hw1_1.java' using 'javac' command.
  Run the program using 'java' command.
# Examples:
# cd /xx/xx/Homework1_Xin_Yang_xy213/Q1/
# javac hw1_1.java
# java hw1_1 ./hw1-1.data/8int.txt

- Import into IDE, change test cases then compile and run.

Two Ways To Change The File Path:
- When running program in command line, the first argument after the class name shall be the path.
# e.g. 'java hw1_1 /Users/Desktop/testcase.txt'

- Open the main .java file in an editor e.g. hw1_1.java, there are String variables defining the path of test case.
