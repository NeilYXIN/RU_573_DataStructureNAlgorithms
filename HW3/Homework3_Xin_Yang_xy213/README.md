* Q1:
 - This program can achieve the complete balance operations needed in put operation.
 - For unit test, my program assumes all the key and values are integers with the same value.
 - My program will put nodes from 1 to 15 by ascending order by default.
 - To modify the datasets, look into the main function and make changes.
 - My program will print the whole tree after the insertion in pre-order DFS, empty nodes marked as "E".

* Q2:
- My program is based on the reference link.
- My implementation will ask for the total number of nodes.
- Output shows the log(N), average path length of N-sorted insertion and N-random insertion.
- Results will be stored in an Output.txt file for the analysis and plot tools.
- My results are in MyOutput.txt and my graph is as the screenshot file shows.

* Q3:
 - My program is based on the reference link.
 - It will ask you to set the N.
 - Output: the percentage of each put operation, the min, max and average ratio.

* Q4:
 - This program is based on the reference link.
 - It will by default run tests with N from 1 to 10000 and each N for 1000 times.
 - Data are stored into an Output.txt file.
 - My results are keeped in the MyOutput.txt file.
 - The time consumption is about 2.5 hrs running on a single thread of Intel Core i7-8700, I would not recommend to re-run this.

* Q5:
- My program will ask you to type the target number for both select and rank operation and return the corresponding result.
