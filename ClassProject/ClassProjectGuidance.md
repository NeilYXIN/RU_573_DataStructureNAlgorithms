Dear Class,

As you start thinking about your project and team members, please be aware that
your project report (written and oral) will be judged based upon clear and
effective description(s) of:

i. Science and Engineering problem motivating your project and algorithm

ii. Describe and explain the Algorithms employed

iii. Experimental configurations and details

iv. Results and Analysis (of performance)

v. Discussion

I want to elaborate on points (iii) and (iv): I expect you to be able to code-up
the algorithm, execute them at relevant scales so as to extract their
performance behaviour/properties adequately. Also be sure to discuss details of
the experiments performed (how, which machine, data-set used etc). You will need
to submit the code and data-set used, and it must be uploaded along with your
project report.

Please be sure to provide a one paragraph detailed description of the
role/contribution of each team member (Strongly recommended: team size of 3 or
4. Any deviation from the recommendation must have explicit approval).

I hope the above gives you enough structure, yet gives you flexibility to chose
and structure your project creatively. Regarding pre-reports (proposals):
Please submit project pre-report via a 1 page (2 side) max hard copy at the
start of class on 08 March Please don't email).

As a reminder, the pre-report should contain title, team members, project
description which should contain: i. Science and Engineering problem motivating
your project and algorithm, ii. Describe and explain the Algorithms employed,
and iii. planned experimental configurations and details.

I will make a couple of sample reports available on Sakai under resources.

Best,
Shantenu
